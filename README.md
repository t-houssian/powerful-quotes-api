# Overview
As a software engineer, I wanted to learn how to build my own API so I decided to do some reasearch into Fast API (https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and build one.

This API is to provide either a json of random powerufl quotes or a json with a random powerful quote. This API can be used in applications or websites to retrieve a random quote.
